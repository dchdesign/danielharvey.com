          <h3>about me</h3>

          <p> I had a fairly stereotypical adolescence growing up in the suburbs of Guelph, Ontario. At 16, I joined the photography club at school, and realized what I wanted to do with the rest of my time traversing this planet. However, one year later, my plans were dashed when I sustained a spinal cord injury after falling off of a trampoline. Without the ability to hold a camera, I forgot about those photography plans, and navigated my way through a B.A. and M.A. in Media Studies, at Western University. Then, on a magical day in 2014, I purchased a robotic device that enabled me to hold and manipulate my camera. Instantly, those photography dreams were once again a reality. I have not stopped capturing light since. I am also currently working on an M.A. in Web and Digital Design at the University of Florida -- to add a few more tools to my toolbox.</p>

          <h3>about my photography</h3>

          <p> I specialize in portrait and product photography. I can produce anything from an individual headshot, some simple product photos for your website, to an elaborate themed group portrait or big budget commercial project. I use professional Hasselblad studio quality cameras and Broncolor lights to ensure that the finished product is extremely high quality — something many other photographers can’t offer.</p>
